Let’s head on over to the Datacenter. If we’ve explored enough, and talked to everyone, the Elder Gnome has given us a good hint about the outside of the Datacenter, as well as navigating the maze inside. If we look around the outside of the Datacenter, we see that there are some colored bricks on the outside. If we assign Black = 0 and White = 1, we get 01101001 01101101 01100001 01101110 01101111 01001011. If we take this to CyberChef, we see that this decodes to “imanoK” Even though it’s backwards, the Konami code is legendary!! Up Up Down Down Left Right Left Right B A!! 99 lives!! Oops, wrong game… Since this was put in backwards, let's reverse the code and try A B Right Left Right Left Down Down Up Up when we’re inside the maze.

Once we’ve gone all the way through the maze, we end up in the following room. If we orient ourselves so that the map has north pointing up, we se that there are doors with B UP A at the top. If we spin the orientation around, we see that there’s no doors labeled Left, Right, or Down, so we can assume that in this orientation, the doors with arrows will correspond to the appropriate direction. Now, this took some trial and error, but I figured out that the very first door that we go through here doesn’t matter to the pattern, so go through any door. Then, if we go through the doors in reverse Konami code order, A B R L R L D D U U, we get into Frosty’s Snowglobe Lab, and with it, the Snow Crystal!
